# educational_level
This project was made in my carreer, System Analist, in National University of Rio Cuarto, from CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. It was my first project in C.
# Education Level Classifier by Age

This is a simple C program that asks the user to input an age and determines the corresponding educational level based on that age.

## ðŸ§  How it works

The program prompts the user to enter an age (e.g., 10) and displays the corresponding education level, following this logic:

- **1 to 4 years** â†’ Pre-school level
- **5 years** â†’ Kindergarten
- **6 to 11 years** â†’ Primary school
- **12 to 17 years** â†’ Secondary school
- **Above 17** â†’ University level
- **Other cases** â†’ Invalid age

## ðŸš€ How to run

Compile the code using `gcc` or any standard C compiler:

```bash
gcc education_level.c -o education_level
./education_level
